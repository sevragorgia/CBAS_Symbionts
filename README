# CBAS Symbiont resources

This repository provides a number of scripts to work with bacterial genomes deposited in the NCBI ftp server and a number of scripts I use to compare these genomes against the genomes of CBAS Symbionts.

NOTE:

most of these scripts are bash scripts. I know, I know... but sorry, I love bash scripts. They should run fine in almost all linux distributions. I try to document their usage in this **README**.
